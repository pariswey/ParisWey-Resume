        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Paris Wey. I am currently a second year undeclared CHASS major. For my first two years of college I was really interested and determined to go into the medical field of some sort but that has all changed. I thought I had it all figured it out but it turns out that was not the case. I have now decided to transition over to a business major with a concentration in management and a minor in marketing. As of right now I do have a background in biology and I am currently working toward learning more about business. I have always tended to be a hardworking person and someone that has always set goals in my life. I am determined to make myself into something that my parents will be proud of. My parents have always wanted me to be more successful than them and I strive to do my best in school for them. <br><br>

        Not only am I motivated and determined to do my best in school, I am also a team player. Currently I have a job as a Residential Advisor at the University of California Riverside. This is my first year living on campus as well as my first year on staff for residential life. Working for the University of California Riverside has taught me lots of things to help me grow as a person in a professional and non professional environment. I have learned how to be a better leader with people that are close to me in age. At first it was a hard adjustment because of course I wanted to be friends with my residents but I had to make the distinction between friends and a leadership role at times. Also with the job as a Residential Advisor it has helped build my team working skills tremendously. Life can be super unpredictable at times and things will pop up so sometimes that means that you have to step up; even if that means taking a shift on a day that you originally didnâ€™t plan for. I have learned that felxivility and stepping up to the plate is what makes a team function efficiently. I think good team working skills are very useful in the workforce and veryday life becuase if you cannot work with other people there is no way you can function in a professional setting. A lot of the time people in a team all do different things and when you come together big things can get done. <br><br>

        In the next two years of college I am very excited to continue to grow as a person and academically. I feel like the next two years of college are crucial in figuring out exactly what my passions are and what I want to do with my bachelors degree. I know that after I graduate from the Uniiversity of California Riverside I want to attend another University to get my masters in business. Once I have my MBA I think that I will know at this point what I want to do with my life.
